# Requirements

Functional and technical requirements for the `java-project-template` project.

---

## High-Level Goals

- Provide a standardized, minimal, and fully configured starter project template for Java development using Gradle.
- Enable developers and AI assistants to bootstrap clean, production-ready Java projects adhering to cross-project development guidelines.
- Provide out-of-the-box support for unit testing with JUnit 5, JDK toolchain pinning, manifest-based versioning, and GitHub Actions CI.
- Supply an automated scaffolding tool (`create` subcommand) that clones and renames the template cleanly into new project repositories.

## Functional Requirements

### CLI Entry Point
- Provide a subcommand-driven CLI supporting standard commands:
  - `help` (and `--help`, `-h`): displays tool version, description, usage, and exit codes.
  - `version` (and `--version`): displays `{name} v{version} - {copyright}` in a single line.
  - `greet [name]`: sample business logic action demonstrating CLI-to-core dispatch.
  - `create <project-name> [-o <output-dir>]`: scaffolds a new project as a renamed copy of the template.
- Exit with code 0 on successful command completion or help/version invocation; exit with non-zero on errors.

### Core Logic Separation
- Maintain clear separation between CLI parsing/IO (`myproject.Cli`), business logic (`myproject.Core`), and template scaffolding machinery (`myproject.Scaffold`).
- Ensure core business logic remains independent of console streams, exit calls, or CLI frameworks for seamless unit testing.

### Project Scaffolding
- Automate repository renaming, package restructuring, and fresh metadata in `CHANGELOG.md`, `TODO.md`, and `gradle.properties`.
- Initialize `gradle.properties` at `0.1.0-pre`, with a matching `## v0.1.0-pre` changelog heading.
- Initialize TODO metadata with `**Next ID:** 0001` and empty peer-level Next Milestone and Backlog sections.
- Prevent accidental overwrite when target directories already exist.

### Logging
- Provide a minimal reference logging implementation (`myproject.Log`) satisfying the cross-project logging
  guideline: formatted, timestamped log lines, level gating, and an optional append-only log file.
- Support `--debug` (enables `DEBUG`-level messages, discarded by default) and `--log-file <path>` (appends
  formatted log lines to `<path>` in addition to the console) as global CLI options.
- Log a multi-line startup message (name, version, command, config) and a completion summary (duration, exit
  code) around operational commands (`greet`, `create`); `help`/`version` stay single-line and unlogged.

## Technical Requirements

- **Java Version**: Explicitly targeted and compiled with Java 25 toolchain (`java.toolchain`).
- **Build System**: Gradle with pinned Gradle wrapper (`gradlew` / `gradlew.bat`).
- **Build Defaults**: Enable build caching, all warnings, rich console output, and info logging through root Gradle properties.
- **Ownership Metadata**: Declare author and a literal copyright notice in `gradle.properties` for derived projects.
- **Testing**: JUnit 5 Jupiter test framework with JUnit platform launcher.
- **Packaging**: Standard application plugin configuration generating runnable jar archives with manifest attributes (`Main-Class`, `Implementation-Title`, `Implementation-Version`, `Implementation-Vendor`).
- **Build Timestamp**: Stamp the application JAR with `Build-Time` as an ISO-8601 UTC configuration timestamp by default.
- **Reproducibility Tradeoff**: Accept changing application archives and repeated packaging while preserving caching for other eligible tasks.
- **Companion Archives**: Generate source and Javadoc jars during `build`, including subprojects using the documented common convention.
- **Javadoc**: Generate HTML5 documentation with doclint disabled and quiet output; retain failure on Javadoc errors.
- **Code Standards**: 2-space indentation, UTF-8 encoding, US English, and LF line endings except CRLF for `.bat` and `.cmd` scripts.
- **Binary Assets**: Declare common image, document, Java archive, compiled class, and font formats as binary in Git attributes.
